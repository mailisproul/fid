  <h2><b>Low and Slow</b></h2>
  <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i><dfn>sous vide</dfn></i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the
    target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <i><strong>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>
